          <p>I have found myself spending ever increasing amounts of time developing in Go (golang). Not because I need to, but because it&rsquo;s a refreshing change from my usual. One thing I was interested in however was simply getting my code to work <em>almost</em> anywhere which is harder with Go seeing as it needs a platform to target.</p>

<p>Initially I installed Go manually following the instructions on their website. I then started to see an abbreviation cropping up in places that caught my attention. <a href="https://github.com/moovweb/gvm" title="Go Version Manager">GVM (Go Version Manager)</a>. It is essentially the rbenv to ruby.</p>

<p>I won&rsquo;t put the installation instructions here. Don&rsquo;t be lazy just click through and have a read it is dead simple. My favourite feature of GVM wasn&rsquo;t the ease of installation as frankly Go is easy to install without it but the fact it rolled up all I needed to cross compile my code without me having to do any looking up. I just hacked together a bash script that would do the job for me.</p>

<p>First off set-up GVM and then install a version of Go. Then we can install the software required to compile for the various platforms. To do this I wrote the following:</p>

<pre><code>for GOOS in linux darwin windows
do
  for GOARCH in amd64 386
  do
    gvm cross $GOOS $GOARCH
  done
done
</code></pre>

<p>Once that is complete you should now be able to create a helper script to do the actual compilation. Feel free to customise to your needs.</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/bash
APPNAME=example
for GOOS in linux darwin windows
do
  for GOARCH in amd64 386
  do
    GO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=$GOOS GOARCH=$GOARCH go build -o &quot;bin/$APPNAME$GOOS-$GOARCH&quot; &quot;$APPNAME.go&quot;
  done
done
</code></pre>

<p>Make the script executable and now you should have a very crude way of cross compiling your go projects.</p>

<p>Remember this isn&rsquo;t meant to be a one size fits all. It got me up and running quickly. There is almost certainly going to be a more comprehensive way of doing this but I didn&rsquo;t need it. All I needed were these few lines of bash and GVM.</p>
