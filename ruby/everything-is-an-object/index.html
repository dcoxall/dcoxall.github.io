<p>The first thing to learn about Ruby is that <em>everything is an object</em>. The best way to make use of the languages features are to develop in an Object-Orientated way. This being the first article in many about learning Ruby, I will walk you through <em>classes</em> and <em>objects</em>. Ready?</p>

<p>If you would like to follow along make sure you install Ruby and then create a file called <code>learn_ruby_01.rb</code>.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-a-class:39aabd223f74e19e15ccec60af1d2d47">What is a Class?</h2>

<p>Classes in Ruby are basically containers. They store methods that can be used and provide systems in which to store data. The main use of a class is to define something that can be created multiple times, each time with it&rsquo;s own unique data.</p>

<p>Classes can be defined like so:</p>

<pre><code>class MyFirstClass
  def hello
    puts &quot;Hello, World!&quot;
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>The first line declares the class name (&lsquo;MyFirstClass&rsquo; in this example). Everything between this and <code>end</code> is the class definition. The definition in my example has a <code>hello</code> method indicated by the <code>def</code> (I believe it stands for define). Everything between the define and the next <code>end</code> is contained in the <code>hello</code> method.</p>

<p>On line 3 we call a method called <code>puts</code> with the text &ldquo;Hello, World!&rdquo;. This line will output the text to the terminal/console window.</p>

<p>Putting it all together we can see that we have a class called MyFirstClass which has 1 method - <code>hello</code> - which will put &ldquo;Hello, World!&rdquo; in the terminal when called.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-an-object:39aabd223f74e19e15ccec60af1d2d47">What is an Object?</h2>

<p>Continuing from our previous example we now create an <em>object</em> of <code>MyFirstExample</code>. To do that add the following to the bottom of our example file.</p>

<pre><code>class MyFirstClass
  def hello
    puts &quot;Hello, World!&quot;
  end
end

# This is a comment. Below we create an object.
object = MyFirstObject.new
object.hello
</code></pre>

<p>If you now run our file with <code>ruby /path/to/example.rb</code> you will see that it outputs &ldquo;Hello, World!&rdquo;.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve created our own class but Ruby provides many to begin with. In-fact we have used 3 in our example:</p>

<ol>
<li><code>puts</code> is a method on a class called <code>Object</code> which is what amost everything in Ruby branches from.</li>
<li>We pass text to the <code>puts</code> method but the text itself is an object of a class called <code>String</code>. Strings are just a code representation of text. Another way of showing this is <code>String.new(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;)</code>.</li>
<li>Obviously the third is our own class - <code>MyFirstClass</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p>Ruby has a great many classes to help us start. Below is an example of a small number available to us:</p>

<pre><code># Numeric represents numbers
# It has many subclasses such as:
234.class # =&gt; Fixnum - integers
234.56.class # =&gt; Float - decimals

# Array represents lists of objects
[1,2,3].class # =&gt; Array
[&quot;sentence one&quot;, &quot;sentence two&quot;].class # =&gt; Array

# Hash represents a list of key value pairs
{ :key_name =&gt; &quot;key value&quot; }.class # =&gt; Hash
{ &quot;text key&quot; =&gt; 1234  }.class # =&gt; Hash

# Even the current script is a class
self.class # =&gt; Object
</code></pre>

<p>Next time we will look at ways we can add to classes both our own and the core classes. For now though let&rsquo;s recap. We have learnt that we can use classes to group and represent logic and code. We can create instances of classes - known as objects - which can call the defined methods. Finally we have also learnt that Ruby has many classes ready for us to use right away.</p>
